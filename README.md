# eBay Scraper

The purpose of this project is to scrape completed eBay listings for Coins in my collection and
then display the results graphically.

The project uses a NodeJS back-end with Puppeteer for scraping as well as Express to create the
endpoints. The front-end uses React. I store the data for each coin in a Firebase realtime store.
